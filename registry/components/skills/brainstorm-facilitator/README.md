# Brainstorm Facilitator

## When to Use

- User says "let's brainstorm", "I need ideas", or "help me think of..."
- User is stuck and needs creative approaches to a problem
- User wants to explore possibilities before committing to a direction

## Instructions

1. **Clarify the problem** -- before generating ideas, make sure you understand the constraint space
2. **Generate quantity first** -- aim for 10+ ideas before evaluating any; bad ideas spark good ones
3. **Use SCAMPER** -- Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse
4. **Build on ideas** -- "yes, and..." each idea to evolve it rather than judging immediately
5. **Mix perspectives** -- consider the problem from different stakeholders' viewpoints
6. **Categorize the output** -- group ideas into themes (quick wins, big bets, incremental, radical)
7. **Prioritize together** -- after generating, help the user evaluate by feasibility and impact
