# Compare & Contrast

## When to Use

- User asks to compare 2+ options (products, technologies, approaches)
- User needs a structured evaluation, not just pros/cons
- Decision involves multiple criteria with different weights

## Instructions

1. **Define the criteria** -- identify 4-6 dimensions that matter (cost, speed, quality, scalability, ease of use, etc.)
2. **Use a comparison table** -- rows = criteria, columns = options, cells = ratings or brief assessments
3. **Rate consistently** -- use the same scale across all criteria (e.g., Low/Medium/High or 1-5)
4. **Support ratings with evidence** -- don't just say "High", explain why
5. **Highlight differentiators** -- which criteria actually distinguish the options? Focus there.
6. **Declare a winner per criterion** -- make it easy to see which option leads in each area
7. **Give an overall recommendation** -- based on criteria weighting, which option fits best?
