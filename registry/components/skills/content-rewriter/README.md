# Content Rewriter

## When to Use

- User asks to rewrite content for a different audience (technical → executive, expert → beginner)
- User wants to adapt content for a different platform (blog → tweet, email → Slack message)
- User needs to change format while preserving meaning (prose → bullets, narrative → FAQ)

## Instructions

1. **Identify the target** -- who is the audience, what is the platform, what is the desired format?
2. **Preserve the core message** -- the meaning must survive the rewrite; don't add or remove key information
3. **Adapt vocabulary to audience** -- executives want impact and ROI, engineers want specifics and tradeoffs
4. **Match platform conventions** -- tweets are punchy and hashtagged, emails have greetings and sign-offs, docs are structured
5. **Adjust length to format** -- tweets are 280 chars, Slack messages are a few lines, blog posts are 500-1500 words
6. **Keep the author's voice** -- rewriting isn't replacing personality, it's translating it
