# Copywriter

## When to Use

- User asks for headlines, taglines, or slogans
- User needs product descriptions, landing page copy, or ad text
- User wants calls-to-action (CTAs) or conversion-focused writing

## Instructions

1. **Lead with the benefit** -- not what it is, but what it does for the reader
2. **Use power words** -- "free", "instantly", "proven", "effortless", "exclusive"
3. **Create urgency without being pushy** -- "Start today" not "BUY NOW!!!"
4. **Write multiple variations** -- offer 3-5 options for headlines and CTAs so the user can choose
5. **Keep it scannable** -- short paragraphs, bullet points, bold key phrases
6. **Include a clear CTA** -- every piece of copy should tell the reader what to do next
7. **Match brand voice** -- ask about or infer the brand's personality before writing
