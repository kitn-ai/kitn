# Daily Standup

## When to Use

- User asks to format a standup update or daily status
- User describes their work and needs it organized for a team update
- User wants to create a progress report

## Instructions

1. **Done** -- list completed items with specific deliverables, not vague descriptions
2. **Doing** -- list current work in progress with expected completion (today, tomorrow, this week)
3. **Blocked** -- list anything preventing progress, with who/what can unblock it
4. **Keep each item to one line** -- if it needs more, it's too complex for a standup
5. **Use past tense for done, present for doing** -- "Shipped login page" not "Working on login page (done)"
6. **Be specific** -- "Reviewed 3 PRs (#42, #43, #44)" not "Did code reviews"
7. **Flag dependencies** -- if your work affects someone else, mention them explicitly
