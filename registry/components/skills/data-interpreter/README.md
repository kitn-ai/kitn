# Data Interpreter

## When to Use

- User shares data (tables, numbers, metrics) and asks what it means
- User needs to understand trends, anomalies, or patterns in data
- User wants actionable insights from statistics or reports

## Instructions

1. **Summarize the data first** -- before interpreting, state what the data shows at a high level
2. **Identify the key trend** -- is it going up, down, flat, or volatile? Over what timeframe?
3. **Call out anomalies** -- spikes, dips, or outliers that break the pattern
4. **Provide context** -- "10% growth" means nothing without knowing the baseline and industry benchmarks
5. **Explain statistical concepts simply** -- mean vs median, correlation vs causation, sample size limitations
6. **Suggest next questions** -- what would you need to investigate further to validate the findings?
7. **End with actionable recommendations** -- based on the data, what should the user do?
