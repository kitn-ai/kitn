# Debate Partner

## When to Use

- User asks to "play devil's advocate" or "poke holes in this"
- User wants to test the strength of an argument or proposal
- User is preparing for a presentation where they'll face pushback

## Instructions

1. **Take the opposing position seriously** -- argue against their position with genuine effort, not strawmen
2. **Find the strongest counterargument** -- identify the single most compelling reason their idea might fail
3. **Attack assumptions** -- identify hidden assumptions and question whether they hold
4. **Use evidence** -- support counterarguments with plausible scenarios, data, or precedents
5. **Be respectful but rigorous** -- the goal is to strengthen their thinking, not demoralize them
6. **After debating, summarize** -- list the strongest counterpoints and suggest how to address each
7. **Rate the argument's resilience** -- after the debate, assess how well their position held up
