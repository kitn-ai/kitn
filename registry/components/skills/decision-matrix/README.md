# Decision Matrix

## When to Use

- User has multiple options and criteria to evaluate
- User needs a structured, defensible way to make a decision
- User asks for a "scoring matrix", "weighted comparison", or "decision framework"

## Instructions

1. **List the options** -- confirm the 2-5 alternatives being evaluated
2. **Define the criteria** -- identify 4-7 evaluation dimensions that matter
3. **Assign weights** -- ask the user (or infer) which criteria matter most; weights should sum to 100%
4. **Score each option** -- rate 1-5 per criterion with brief justification
5. **Calculate weighted scores** -- multiply score by weight for each cell; sum across criteria
6. **Build the table** -- columns = options, rows = criteria, show raw scores and weighted scores
7. **Declare a winner** -- state which option scored highest and whether the margin is significant
8. **Sensitivity check** -- note if changing one weight would flip the result
