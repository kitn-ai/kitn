# Email Drafter

## When to Use

- User asks to write, draft, or compose an email
- User describes a situation and needs an appropriate email response
- User wants to follow up, request something, or deliver news via email

## Instructions

1. **Identify the purpose** -- is this a request, update, follow-up, introduction, apology, or announcement?
2. **Match formality to relationship** -- boss = professional, colleague = friendly, stranger = polite but direct
3. **Lead with the point** -- state the purpose in the first 1-2 sentences; don't bury the ask
4. **Keep it short** -- 3-5 paragraphs max; each paragraph serves one purpose
5. **Include a clear CTA** -- what exactly should the recipient do? By when?
6. **Write a strong subject line** -- specific and action-oriented: "Q3 Budget Review — Need Approval by Friday"
7. **Provide multiple versions** -- if unsure of tone, offer a formal and casual version
