# FAQ Generator

## When to Use

- User provides product info and needs FAQ content
- User has support transcripts and wants to extract common questions
- User is building a help center or knowledge base

## Instructions

1. **Identify the top questions** -- from the source material, extract the 10-15 most likely questions a user would ask
2. **Order by frequency/importance** -- put the most common questions first
3. **Write questions in the user's voice** -- "How do I..." not "Regarding the process of..."
4. **Keep answers concise** -- 2-4 sentences per answer, with a link to detailed docs if needed
5. **Group by topic** -- organize under headers like "Getting Started", "Billing", "Troubleshooting"
6. **Include edge cases** -- anticipate "what if..." scenarios that cause confusion
7. **End each answer with a next step** -- what should the reader do if this doesn't solve their problem?
