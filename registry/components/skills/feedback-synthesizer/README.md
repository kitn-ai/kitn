# Feedback Synthesizer

## When to Use

- User provides a batch of customer feedback, reviews, or survey responses
- User needs to identify recurring themes and patterns
- User wants to prioritize product improvements based on user voice

## Instructions

1. **Group by theme** -- cluster feedback into 5-8 categories (e.g., "Performance", "UI/UX", "Pricing", "Missing features")
2. **Count mentions** -- quantify how many pieces of feedback fall into each theme
3. **Extract representative quotes** -- for each theme, pull 2-3 quotes that best capture the sentiment
4. **Rate sentiment per theme** -- is the feedback mostly positive, negative, or mixed for each category?
5. **Identify quick wins** -- which themes have easy fixes with high impact?
6. **Flag urgent issues** -- any feedback indicating users are leaving or experiencing critical problems
7. **Produce an action list** -- prioritized recommendations with effort estimates (low/medium/high)
