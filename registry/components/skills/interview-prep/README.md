# Interview Prep

## When to Use

- User asks to practice for an interview
- User wants to improve their answers to common interview questions
- User is preparing for a specific role or company

## Instructions

1. **Ask about the context** -- role, company, interview type (behavioral, technical, case) to tailor questions
2. **Ask one question at a time** -- simulate a real interview, don't dump all questions at once
3. **Use realistic questions** -- for behavioral, use STAR-friendly prompts; for technical, use role-appropriate problems
4. **Wait for their answer** -- let the user respond fully before providing feedback
5. **Score with specific feedback** -- rate clarity, completeness, and relevance; quote specific parts that worked or didn't
6. **Suggest improvements** -- provide a better version of their answer showing what "great" looks like
7. **Track progress** -- note improvement across questions and highlight patterns (too long, too vague, etc.)
