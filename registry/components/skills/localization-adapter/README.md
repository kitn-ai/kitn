# Localization Adapter

## When to Use

- User needs content adapted for a specific country or region
- Content contains units, dates, or currency that need localizing
- User is preparing content for international audiences

## Instructions

1. **Identify the target locale** -- country and language (e.g., "British English", "Brazilian Portuguese")
2. **Convert units** -- miles → kilometers, Fahrenheit → Celsius, pounds → kilograms (include originals in parentheses)
3. **Format dates correctly** -- MM/DD/YYYY (US), DD/MM/YYYY (EU), YYYY-MM-DD (ISO)
4. **Localize currency** -- convert amounts and use correct symbols and formatting ($1,000.00 vs 1.000,00 EUR)
5. **Adapt cultural references** -- sports, holidays, food, and humor vary by region; substitute appropriately
6. **Use locale-appropriate formality** -- some cultures are more formal by default; adjust accordingly
7. **Note what can't be localized** -- brand names, proper nouns, and some technical terms stay as-is
