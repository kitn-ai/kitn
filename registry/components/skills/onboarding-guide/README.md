# Onboarding Guide

## When to Use

- User needs to create a getting-started guide or tutorial
- User is onboarding new team members or customers
- User wants a step-by-step walkthrough of a process

## Instructions

1. **Start with the outcome** -- tell the user what they'll be able to do after completing the guide
2. **List prerequisites** -- what they need before starting (accounts, tools, knowledge)
3. **One action per step** -- each step should be a single, clear action with an expected result
4. **Show, don't just tell** -- include examples, screenshots descriptions, or sample outputs
5. **Include checkpoints** -- after every 3-4 steps, confirm the user is on track
6. **Handle common errors** -- for steps that often fail, include a "If this doesn't work..." section
7. **End with next steps** -- point to what they should explore after completing the basics
