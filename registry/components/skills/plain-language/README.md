# Plain Language

## When to Use

- Text contains industry jargon, acronyms, or technical terms the audience may not know
- User asks to "simplify", "make it clearer", or "explain in plain English"
- Content needs to be accessible to a non-specialist audience

## Instructions

1. **Replace jargon with everyday words** -- "utilize" → "use", "facilitate" → "help", "leverage" → "take advantage of"
2. **Unpack acronyms on first use** -- spell them out, then use the short form
3. **Use short sentences** -- aim for 15-20 words per sentence; split long ones
4. **Prefer active voice** -- "The team completed the project" not "The project was completed by the team"
5. **Define technical terms inline** -- if you must use a term, explain it immediately in parentheses
6. **Use concrete examples** -- abstract concepts need real-world illustrations to land
7. **Test with the "would my neighbor understand this?" rule** -- if not, simplify further
