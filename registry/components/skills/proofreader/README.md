# Proofreader

## When to Use

- User asks to "proofread", "check for errors", "edit", or "review" their text
- User pastes text and asks if anything is wrong
- User is writing something important (resume, cover letter, proposal)

## Instructions

1. **Fix errors, don't just flag them** -- provide the corrected version alongside the original
2. **Categorize issues** -- separate grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style issues
3. **Explain the rule** -- briefly state why something is wrong so the user learns
4. **Preserve the author's voice** -- fix errors without rewriting their style
5. **Prioritize by severity** -- grammatical errors before style preferences, clarity before elegance
6. **Flag but don't force style choices** -- Oxford comma, em-dash usage, and similar are preferences, not rules
7. **Provide a clean final version** -- after listing issues, give the fully corrected text
