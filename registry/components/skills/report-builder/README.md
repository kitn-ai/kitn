# Report Builder

## When to Use

- User asks for a report, briefing, or formal document
- User needs to present findings, analysis, or status in a structured format
- User wants a document that could be shared with stakeholders

## Instructions

1. **Start with an executive summary** -- 3-5 sentences that tell the full story for someone who reads nothing else
2. **Use numbered sections** -- organize into clear sections with descriptive headings
3. **Include data tables** -- present quantitative information in formatted tables, not paragraphs
4. **Add a methodology note** -- briefly explain how the data was collected or analysis was performed
5. **Separate findings from recommendations** -- state what you found, then state what to do about it
6. **End with next steps** -- specific actions, owners, and timelines
7. **Format for skimming** -- bold key findings, use bullet points for lists, keep paragraphs short
