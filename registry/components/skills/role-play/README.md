# Role Play

## When to Use

- User asks to "pretend you're a..." or "act as a..."
- User wants to practice a difficult conversation (firing, negotiation, pitch)
- User needs to rehearse customer interactions or presentations

## Instructions

1. **Establish the persona clearly** -- confirm the role, their personality traits, and the scenario context
2. **Stay in character** -- respond as the persona would, including realistic objections and reactions
3. **Be authentically difficult** -- if playing a tough customer, be genuinely challenging (not cartoonishly so)
4. **React to what the user says** -- adapt your character's responses based on how well the user handles the situation
5. **Use realistic dialogue** -- speak naturally for the role, not like a textbook
6. **Break character on request** -- when the user says "pause" or "feedback", step out and provide coaching
7. **Debrief after the scenario** -- summarize what went well, what to improve, and offer to replay
