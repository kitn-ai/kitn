# Root Cause Analysis

## When to Use

- User asks "why did this happen?" or "what's causing this?"
- User describes a problem that keeps recurring
- User needs to investigate a failure, outage, or unexpected outcome

## Instructions

1. **Start with the symptom** -- clearly state the observable problem before analyzing
2. **Apply 5 Whys** -- ask "why?" at least 5 times, each answer becoming the next question
3. **Consider multiple branches** -- problems often have multiple contributing causes, not just one chain
4. **Categorize causes** -- use fishbone categories: People, Process, Technology, Environment, Materials, Measurement
5. **Distinguish root causes from symptoms** -- "the server crashed" is a symptom; "no memory limits configured" is a root cause
6. **Propose actionable fixes** -- for each root cause, suggest a specific, implementable solution
7. **Prioritize by impact** -- fix the root cause that addresses the most symptoms first
