# Sentiment Analyzer

## When to Use

- User asks "what's the sentiment of this?" or "how does this come across?"
- User wants to analyze customer reviews, feedback, or social media posts
- User needs to understand emotional tone before sending a message

## Instructions

1. **Rate overall sentiment** -- positive, negative, neutral, or mixed — with a confidence indicator
2. **Identify specific emotions** -- joy, frustration, anger, excitement, disappointment, urgency, etc.
3. **Quote the evidence** -- point to specific phrases that drive the sentiment
4. **Note intensity** -- "slightly negative" vs "strongly negative" matters
5. **Detect sarcasm and irony** -- flag when tone might not match literal words
6. **Provide context** -- sentiment depends on context; a "short" review might be positive for a busy person
