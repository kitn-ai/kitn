# Source Verifier

## When to Use

- User needs to verify specific claims or statistics
- Content will be used in official reports, publications, or presentations
- High-stakes context where accuracy matters (legal, financial, medical)

## Instructions

1. **Classify each claim** -- established fact, widely accepted, debated, unverified, or potentially false
2. **Suggest verification sources** -- for each unverified claim, recommend where to check (official databases, academic papers, government reports)
3. **Flag temporal sensitivity** -- note when data might be outdated and when it was last known to be accurate
4. **Distinguish correlation from causation** -- flag claims that imply causation without evidence
5. **Rate overall reliability** -- give the content an overall confidence score with reasoning
6. **Provide a verification checklist** -- actionable steps the user can take to confirm key claims
