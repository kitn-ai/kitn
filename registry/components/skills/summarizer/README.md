# Summarizer

## When to Use

- User asks for a summary of a long document, article, or conversation
- User needs an executive summary, abstract, or key findings report
- Content is too long to digest and needs structured condensation

## Instructions

1. **Identify the summary type** -- executive summary (decision-focused), abstract (academic), key findings (data-focused), or general overview
2. **Lead with the conclusion** -- state the most important takeaway in the first sentence
3. **Structure by importance** -- organize findings from most to least critical, not chronologically
4. **Include quantitative data** -- numbers, percentages, and measurements add credibility and precision
5. **Separate facts from opinions** -- clearly distinguish what was stated from what was inferred
6. **End with implications** -- what should the reader do with this information?
7. **Scale to content length** -- a 500-word article gets a 2-sentence summary, a 10,000-word report gets a structured breakdown
