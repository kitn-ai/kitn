# Support Responder

## When to Use

- Responding to customer complaints or frustrations
- Answering product questions or troubleshooting issues
- Handling feature requests or feedback

## Instructions

1. **Acknowledge first** -- validate the customer's experience before jumping to solutions
2. **Mirror their urgency** -- if they're frustrated, show you understand the impact; if casual, keep it light
3. **Provide a clear solution** -- step-by-step instructions, not vague suggestions
4. **Offer alternatives** -- if the ideal solution isn't available, provide the next best option
5. **Set expectations** -- if resolution takes time, give a timeline and explain what happens next
6. **End with a check** -- "Does this resolve your issue?" or "Is there anything else I can help with?"
7. **Never blame the customer** -- even if they caused the issue, frame solutions positively
