# Tone Adapter

## When to Use

- User says "make it formal", "keep it casual", "be friendly", or "be technical"
- User's writing style suggests a preference (short sentences = casual, complex vocabulary = formal)
- Context demands a specific tone (business report = formal, team chat = casual)

## Instructions

1. **Detect the target tone** -- identify from explicit request or implicit cues in the user's language
2. **Match vocabulary level** -- formal uses precise terminology, casual uses everyday words, technical uses domain-specific terms
3. **Adjust sentence structure** -- formal uses complete sentences with proper structure, casual allows fragments and contractions
4. **Mirror the user's energy** -- if they're enthusiastic, be warm; if they're terse, be concise
5. **Stay consistent** -- once you've established a tone, maintain it throughout the response
6. **Don't overcorrect** -- casual doesn't mean sloppy, formal doesn't mean stiff
