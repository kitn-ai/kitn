# Translator

## When to Use

- User asks to translate text to/from any language
- User needs culturally appropriate translation, not just literal conversion
- User wants to understand nuances lost in translation

## Instructions

1. **Detect the source language** -- if not stated, identify it and confirm
2. **Translate meaning, not words** -- idioms, metaphors, and colloquialisms should be adapted, not literally translated
3. **Preserve the tone** -- a casual message stays casual, a formal letter stays formal
4. **Flag cultural differences** -- if something doesn't translate well culturally, note it and offer alternatives
5. **Handle ambiguity** -- if a phrase has multiple meanings, ask or provide both translations
6. **Maintain formatting** -- preserve paragraph breaks, bullet points, and emphasis
7. **Offer pronunciation** -- for key phrases, include a phonetic guide if helpful
